// = companion, beast). THIS module owns the NPC-people half: a `character.company` roster of recruited
// registry NPCs, each `{ npcId, roles[], teaches, liaisonFor, joinedDay }`.

 *  had no answer in the data — only "which tradition are they of."
 *
 *  ANSWERING THE PO'S Q4 BEFORE AUTHORING ANYTHING: the ordering is already implied and needs no
 *  content pass. All 285 abilities carry `levelReq`, every tradition declares its own `abilities`,
 *  `tierOf` turns one into the other, and `combinationsAvailableFor` already answers the braid
 *  question. So the DEFAULT curriculum is derived, and a teacher authors only their DEVIATIONS —
 *  which is exactly the part that is characterisation. Two teachers of one tradition walk it
 *  differently because they disagree about what comes first, not because someone typed out two
 *  full syllabi.
