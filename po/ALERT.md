# PIPELINE ALERT — Singularity## ⚡ SNG-113 — Aptitudes expansion — ✅ PROMOTED (Erik 2026-07-14) → CCode ROUND 2 (engine) + Aevi authoring (roster) in parallel

`po/SPEC_SNG-113_aptitudes_expansion.md` (v3, ROUND-2-ready). **Erik promoted.** Split two ways:
- **CCode ROUND 2 — the MECHANISM:** background `grantsAptitudes`; move `DECAY` to rules + raise (~0.975) + hysteresis (earn at threshold / keep until threshold−margin — **requires `deriveAptitudes` to track held state; it's stateless today, stated as a requirement not a question**); inverse-threshold engine for innocence (held while composite worldliness < ceiling); route orphaned `romantic`/`flirt` tags → new `amorous` tendency; "fading" surfacing. Three genuine confirm-at-HEAD questions remain.
- **Aevi authoring — the ROSTER (in parallel):** the ~18–24 aptitude definitions themselves (earned + amorous + inverse), each a balanced bonus-AND-cost, + the new-tendency intent-tag additions. Aevi content, like the axis-touch combos. **Starting now.**
- **Dependency declared:** `devoted_lover` reads the SNG-108 partner bond → ship after 108 or ship inert. Rest builds independently.

## 🎒 SNG-114 — Inventory unify + intentful "Use in scene" (specced, awaiting CCode)
`po/SPEC_SNG-114_inventory_unify_use_intent.md`. **Two findings, one ticket.** (1) "Use in scene" on a non-consumable literally submits `onFreeform("I use my X here")` — a canned, intent-less text action the GM must guess at; storied items (Pell's whetstone) deserve better. Fix: item `uses:[{label,prompt}]` + a "how?" field, generic prompt as fallback. (2) **Redundancy confirmed in code:** two separate item-card renderers — popup (`data-invuse`, shows effects) and play sidebar (`data-use`, shows image) — same 3 actions, different attrs/handlers/features, and **already drifted** (invuse vs use behave differently). Consolidate to one `itemCard` superset component; parity test so "Use in scene" does ONE thing regardless of surface.

## 📚 THE CHARACTER CHRONICLE ARC + 3 bugs (Aevi authored 2026-07-14, awaiting CCode ROUND 2)

Erik play-session findings — the through-line is the session thesis: **the game computes the accreted self (deeds, bonds, standing, grown items) but shows the player almost none of it.** These surface and weave it.

**Bugs (found live):**
- **SNG-111 — Progressive NPC naming.** `po/SPEC_SNG-111_progressive_npc_naming.md`. Learning a surname must EXTEND the name ("Pell" → "Pell Marsh"), not alias-shunt it. At HEAD `revealName` only replaces-or-aliases; no append path. Pell's "Marsh" never composed.
- **SNG-112 — Quest offers gated by proximity/thread, not region.** `po/SPEC_SNG-112_quest_offer_gating.md`. `availableStructuredQuests` offers on bare `region===region` — too coarse; Cellaceron's Fendt quest surfaced to Silas off-thread and far from its location. Gate on location-proximity OR giver-present OR thread-touched. **+ parallel player-specific quests on a shared arc** (Silas's own Fendt quest, not Cellaceron's canonical one).
- **SNG-105 — Recovery scales with pool.** `po/SPEC_SNG-105_recovery_scales.md`. Erik ruled recovery should scale: maxEnergy grows +5/level, recovery was flat → grind. Fraction-of-max with flat floor (low levels unchanged).

**The Chronicle set (surfaces + weaves existing data):**
- **SNG-108 — Relationship arcs.** `po/SPEC_SNG-108_relationship_arcs.md`. Bonds already tracked (score+band, fed to GM) but never SHOWN, and flat. Surface them + add `bondType`/`bondStage`: **Pell is a `romantic`/committed partner, not a "devoted" tag** — a distinct KIND with a growth path (courting→together→committed→partner), score-floor-gated, minor-safe, partner→party-adjacent. *"She's Silas' woman"* — the model should say so.
- **SNG-109 — The Chronicle page.** `po/SPEC_SNG-109_chronicle_page.md`. The background page: cached story-so-far paragraph, major deeds, relationships (SNG-108 bonds), standing, arc. Assembles existing data; reads the attended self back to the player.
- **SNG-110 — Portrait as earned record.** `po/SPEC_SNG-110_portrait_earned_record.md`. Player-authored appearance (primary) + game-context provenance (the **forged spear shown as *yours***, not a bare name), companion/partner in-frame opt-in, per-generation override, and **image DELETE** (Erik's ask; only add exists today). FLOORS run after all additions (minor ≤PG, AUP).

**Design forks still Erik's to call (flagged in specs, not pre-decided):** SNG-107 reputation-with-teeth (what should revered actually COST — a rival faction souring, challengers drawn — reputation that only helps isn't a system) is NOT yet specced, pending Erik's design conversation. SNG-108's romantic stages and SNG-110's companion-in-frame are built but Erik tunes the specifics.

Sequencing note: 108 (bonds) feeds 109 (chronicle) and 110 (portrait companion). 111/112/105 are independent bugs, buildable anytime. All await CCode ROUND 2.

## ✅ THREE TRANSPARENCY BUILDS — CLOSED GREEN (Aevi HEAD audit, v1.8.67)

CCode shipped all three; **Aevi verified at authenticated origin, not on report.** All syntax-clean.
- **SNG-103** (GM effective energy cost, v1.8.65): `abilitiesForGM` now shows effective cost with base when discounted (`3 energy — base 6, discounted by level+rank`); raw `${ab.energyCost}` primary is gone; `CONTENT.rules` threaded at all 3 call sites. No sibling raw-cost builder. **Closed.**
- **SNG-104** (vitals x/y, v1.8.66): `vital-num` + `data-vital` render `current / max` always-visible; `showPopoverText` added (the staged diff assumed showHelp took raw text — it takes a help-id; CCode's fix is correct). **Closed.**
- **SNG-106** (roll breakdown, v1.8.67): **the load-bearing honesty claim VERIFIED at HEAD** — `add()` is the SOLE accumulation site; the only assignments to `chance` are `= 0` init and the increment inside `add()`; no mid-body mutation; clamp applied to a separate returned value. So `sum(components) === chance` (pre-clamp) is true **by construction** — the popup cannot drift from the real math. Opposed term named ("the raider (threat 35) −N"). Behavior-preserving (existing math tests pass); gambit steps inherited it. **Closed.**

## ✅ ROMANCE — CLOSED GREEN (Erik browser leg, 2026-07-14)
Erik verified in play: GM stayed in the scene, carried heat, no fade/hedge/safety-meta. SNG-100 tag-cap fix confirmed live (tag fired → doc loaded → engagement held). The R-vs-R+ observation was NOT a defect — the active profile was correctly on preset R (mature, no explicit anatomy); R held the line precisely, which is itself proof the register rewrite reads the ceiling correctly. Flipping the profile to R+ (adultVerified already true) unlocks the explicit register; Erik confirmed R+ works. **Romance leg + SNG-100 closed.**

## ✅ DOMAIN GROWTH ARC — SHIPPED & CLOSE-VERIFIED (Aevi HEAD audit, v1.8.63)

CCode built all three top-down; **Aevi confirmed at authenticated origin** (not report): `standingWithPeople` · `meetsStandingBar` · `promotionEligible` · `promote` · `acquirable` · `acquireDomain` all present at HEAD. SNG-100b (standing bar, wires the long-fiction accessGates capstone) → SNG-101 (promotion, additive model, foreclosure gates learn + both rank paths, braids exempt, Law-14 throw) → SNG-102 (acquisition, Tier-I entry, closed-opposite never loosened). CCode also fixed a Phase-1 CI bug the classification pass exposed (CI wrongly required `combinationAxis` on the 6 cross-pole braids, which correctly have none — the braid-exemption foundation). Decisions CCode was delegated: standing source = `peopleDisposition`; thresholds in `resolution.json`; region gate loose (no people→region map — flagged); acquisition teacher-bounded. Writeup: `po/results/20260714_domain_growth_arc.md`. **Green.**

## 🐛 SNG-103 — GM effective energy cost (specced, awaiting CCode)
`po/SPEC_SNG-103_gm_effective_energy_cost.md`. `abilitiesForGM` prints base `ab.energyCost`, not effective — GM false-flags correct discounted costs (found live: Silas/Palework 6-vs-3). Fix: thread `CONTENT.rules`, interpolate `effectiveEnergyCost`. Guard: never "repair" base down — that's the real corruption. Awaiting ROUND 2.

## 🖥 SNG-104 — Vitals x/y readout + tap/hover detail (specced + STAGED DIFF, awaiting CCode)
`po/SPEC_SNG-104_vitals_readout.md` + `..._STAGED_DIFF.md` (byte-precise drop-in). The Health/Energy bars show **no number** — that's why Erik couldn't tell if energy was depleting faster or he had less. Adds always-visible `current / max` (zero-tap phone answer) + a tap/hover popover reusing the info-dot delegation (phone parity built in). Verified anchors at HEAD.

## ⚔️ SNG-098 — Skill Battles — ✅ PROMOTED (Erik 2026-07-14) → CCode ROUND 2

`po/SPEC_SNG-098_skill_battles.md`. **Erik promoted to build.** Routed to **CCode ROUND 2 substrate review first** — not blind build. Reason (PO judgment, stated plainly): this is the single most architectural spec of the session — a combat-MODEL change, a new `skill_battle.js` module, and touches `encounters.js`/`sense.js`/`app.js`/tests. This session's repeated lesson was that Aevi specs lean on substrate assumptions that don't hold until CCode verifies at HEAD (§7b duplicated an existing file; the SNG-101 standing bar wasn't wired; §2 was a breaking type change — all caught in ROUND 2). Skipping review on the *biggest* spec would be exactly the wrong call. The spec also carries three real open questions Aevi could not resolve alone:
  1. Can a duel `def.opponent` (threat/tacticTags) synthesize a fair skill sheet, or must the encounter generator author one at spawn?
  2. Does `senseTier` compose cleanly when the sensed "action" is the OPPONENT's declaration rather than the player's own?
  3. Momentum meter — net-new encounter state, or does an existing field generalize?

**CCode: ROUND 2 review → answer the three → then GO for build.** If Erik wants to skip review and build straight off, say so; ROUND 2 is the safer next step for a change this size and is the default.

**The core to preserve through review:** two rolling+deciding agents; opponent decision is deterministic engine `opponentPolicy` (not GM invention); **fog-of-war via `senseTier` is presentation over TRUE state, never false** (tier 0 blind → tier 3 sees their full breakdown); reveal skills buy a tier; PvP falls out symmetric. Depends on SNG-106 (retained roll components).
