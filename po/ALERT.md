## 🔧 SNG-090 — SUBSTRATE AS A SECOND DIFFICULTY MAP (AMENDMENT PROMOTED — ready for CCode build)

**Amendment 1 promoted 2026-07-13.** Data file `the_substrate.json` amended at `1e3403e6`. Spec §9b inserted + §4 formula updated at `34fccefe`. **CCode may now build.**

**The two-sided affinity band (design canon — do not collapse):**
- Each tradition has a `substrateBand.center` and `substrateBand.width`. Inside the band: full output.
- **Below band — starvation (steep).** Continuous traditions (high affinity) near-zero in thin ground. Seraph in Quickwood ≈ 13%.
- **Above band — interference (mild).** Returned traditions (low affinity) impaired in dense ground, floor ~60–75%. Never 13%.
- **Carried substrate** (`density + carried`) pushes Returned craft further above affinity in dense ground → makes it WORSE. Why the Rootkin find the Waystaff trade ridiculous. The battery rescues the Continuous from starvation; it cannot rescue the Returned from interference.

**Resolve-chain contract (engine/substrate.js — does not yet exist):**
- `substratePenalty` = additive chance penalty in `successChance`. **Ability actions only** (weapon swings are substrate-free per SNG-089).
- Hard gate at extreme (says why; never silently fails).
- Optional energy-cost multiplier.
- **SEPARATE from SNG-079 spectral-fit term.** Never fold. Both additive, both independently clamped.
- Receipt line required: "The lattice is thin here" / "The lattice crowds your signal" + GM context + map overlay (alongside `dangerLevel`).

**Data:** `the_substrate.json` — `substrateBand` (center + width per tradition), `substrateDensity` per region. Locations derive from `regionId`; optional per-location override. CI: every location must resolve an effective density.

**Build order:** (1) load `the_substrate.json` + CI check → (2) pure `engine/substrate.js`, tuned by `tests/balance_sim.mjs` — **never eyeball the curves** → (3) wire into `successChance` + gate + energy mult → (4) receipts + GM line + map overlay → (5) carried-charge logistics.

*⚠️ Engine code does not yet exist. Build blocked until `tests/balance_sim.mjs` exists and tunes the curves.*

## ⭐ SNG-079 — AXIAL MISALIGNMENT IS THE DIFFICULTY GATE (Erik-designed, specced, unbuilt)

Spectral fit is ±25 and `poleIntensity` varies 0.05→0.98, but the penalty doesn't bite (base chance inflates from level 5 per SNG-078). The model: misfit penalty scales with `poleIntensity × ring-distance from that place's pole` → your antipode region is the hardest place in the world **for you**. Widen the band and lower the base before this gate can hold. Says so when something is beyond you.

**Dependent on SNG-078 balance pass (Erik's call).**

## 🚨 SNG-078 — THE GAME CEILINGS OUT AT LEVEL 5 (analytic, unbuilt — Erik's call)

`attributeMultiplier: 20` vs `attributeSoftCap: 4` → attribute of 4 = 80% before skill/rank/gear/companion/alignment. Very hard tops at 30; a level-5 character sits at 95%. Tension survives only in modifiers (against-grain −25, exhausted −10, novel −15).

**Levers:** lower `attributeMultiplier` (20 → ~8–10) · widen difficulty band · scale with level. **CCode owes `tests/balance_sim.mjs`.** Erik decides.

## 🎯 ERIK'S CALL

- **Should a place change you?** Standing in the Redline or the Cogitarium should leave a mark — but the mechanic was never built. The spec claimed it; it doesn't exist. A slow spectrum-pull toward a place's poles (with decay) would make "geography = disposition" true of people, not just terrain. Erik decides: feature or road not taken.
- **SNG-078 balance tuning** — see above.

## ⛔ NEXT (build order)

1. **SNG-090** — substrate build. Amendment promoted; `the_substrate.json` and `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §9b both at HEAD. CCode: `engine/substrate.js` + `tests/balance_sim.mjs` first to tune the curves. Full build order above.
2. **SNG-058 — party leader.** (Was next before the substrate sprint opened.)
3. **SNG-084 — in-context helper text.** `content/packs/core/rules/helper_text.json` exists; engine + UI owed.
4. **SNG-089 Ph2** — Accord waygate-journey acquisition · 12 braids → GM · living treaty as world-event.
5. **SNG-078/079** — balance + axial gate (Erik's call; `balance_sim.mjs` first).
6. **SNG-045 Part A** — duplicate-Erik profile merge. Discovery (SNG-087) mitigates; clean fix is a backup-first guarded `mergePlayers(from→to)`. Aevi to author the reconcile or confirm CCode builds it.

## 📋 Owed

**Aevi:**
- `po/OPERATIONAL_FLOWS.md`
- Thin regions: `riven_marches`, `somatic_reaches`, `unspooling` each want ~6 locations
- `po/SPEC_BACKLOG.md` retirement as primary surface (180KB — move active items here)

**CCode:**
- `tests/balance_sim.mjs` (owed since SNG-078 — **now also required before SNG-090 curves go in**)
- §22 debt list from SYSTEM_SPEC R2: slugify in wrong module · worldtime MODE per-player vs "one clock" · `newEncounter` stashes-not-activates · quest stage-conditions advance manually · `narration`↔`effects[]` drift no linter · dead `regenPerRest` key · `parse_probe` can't reach `boot()`
- `withTimeout` pattern on party find/join + roster play/adopt (flagged in SNG-093 commit — non-acute, follow-on)

**Erik:**
- Preview-legs (`po/PREVIEW_LEGS.md`)
- §9 drift call (should a place change you?)
- GH Action for `npm test` (BOUNDARY-2: a gate that only fires when someone remembers to run it is weak against exactly the failure it exists to prevent)
- SNG-076 final leg: confirm no text is cut anywhere in-game (§21: close-on-symptom)
