# PO ALERT — CCode pickup

**2026-07-18 · Aevi (PO).** Read this first, then `SYSTEM_SPEC.md §9b`.

## ⚠️ Retraction before anything else

**Every per-location substrate number I published in `po/PROPOSAL_substrate_border_blend.md`
REV2/REV3 is WITHDRAWN.** You were right to stop. The verification ran from an uncommitted `/tmp`
script, and the formula had a detail no reader could infer (each source's delta measured against
*its own* region's ambient). Don't try to reproduce those numbers — they are not a target.

**The authored content stands. The arithmetic does not.**

## The correction that matters: the engine already does most of this

`carriedSubstrate(character, itemCatalog, companions)` has read `item.substrateCharge` and
`companion.substrateAura` since before this session. I specced a mobile-source resolver that exists.
Erik's direction — **use the engines** — applies to all of it. Assume the capability is there and
look before building.

## What is actually wanted (outcomes — the math is yours)

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md §9b` now documents how substrate works and states six invariants. Those are the
contract. **How** you satisfy them is an engineering decision: kernel shape, falloff form, and
whether the field precomputes into `location.substrateDensity` (the hook `locationDensity` already
reads first) or resolves live. **A simpler function that satisfies the invariants is the better one.**

Two known gaps: `carriedSubstrate` accepts **positives only**, so suppressors/sinks aren't
expressible; and **nothing reads `substrateSource`** — 26 sites are authored and inert.

## Specs awaiting ROUND 2 — all restated as outcomes, not implementations

| spec | in one line |
|---|---|
| **BATCH-12** | substrate geography · standing on the base character schema · teachers that teach · the ENGINE_MAP *(you built it — split accepted)* |
| **SNG-166** | address derivation (`generate.js:70` inherits the player's region, defaults `"valley"`) · region-name deglut · NPC naming. **§3's Mara evidence corrected** — the ratchet must count across the device |
| **SNG-167** | 18 of 27 lore files reachable by no location · NPC-borne quest arcs (41 of 43 have a `want`, none have seeds) · Coliseum standing (**conduct adjudicated from outcome/yield/harm-rung, never model-judged** — your call, adopted) · Haiku-default routing |
| **SNG-168** | map viewport on all three tiers + pinch (touch reads only `e.touches[0]`) · place cards with travel · world feed **distinct from shared canon** · messaging over the waygate network |
| **SNG-169** | `npcImage` imported and never called · `itemImage` gated behind `open` · `.item-name width:100%` wrapping the pin · reuse the ONE `entityHover` popup, don't build a second |
| **SNG-170** | per-profile stakes dial on SNG-144's machinery · **§2 corrected**: 1 of 42 authored NPCs had `appearance`, not most. Content half shipped — 40 authored |

## Shipped content this session (inert until wired)

- **26 `substrateSource` sites** (18 pools, 8 sinks) with authored reasons — nothing reads them yet
- **40 NPC `appearance` fields** — **live now**, `npcPromptSeed` already leads with the field

## Standing

Numbering: `SNG-nnn` PO-minted (check `po/` at HEAD first), `CCODE-nn` yours. Only-Aevi-closes.
Browser-leg is the only accepted proof. Local `npm test` green before every ship — including mine.
