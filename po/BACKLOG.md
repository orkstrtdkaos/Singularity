# PO Backlog — Singularity

*Owned by Aevi (PO). Order below is build order. CCode sessions: active task is always `po/ALERT.md`; this file is the queue behind it. One goal per session — decompose on pickup if a task won't fit one session.*

**Ratifications on record (2026-07-04):** Erik ratified the Encounters direction (SNG-002) — new engine layer on top of existing resolution, resolution math itself unchanged.

## SNG-268 — RING DISTANCE IN THE BRAID GENERATOR (CCode — spec at `po/SPEC_SNG-268_braid_ring_distance.md`)
**Why it is queued rather than left in ALERT:** braids are **minted at runtime**, so anything the three
hand-authored braids taught us leaks unless the GENERATOR knows it. An ALERT entry scrolls; this must not.
**Already correct — do not change:** `deriveMechanic` (SNG-263 §9) unions parents' axes, takes the stronger
field, makes a REFUSED intensity contagious, and **deliberately does not inherit bounds.** All verified right.
**The gap:** `braidBaseCost` asks how EXPENSIVE the parents are, never how FAR APART. Adjacent and antipodal
braids currently cost and read identically.
**The evidence:** all three authored braids — `meaning_engine` (enginewright+numinous), `harbored_flame`
(umbral+blazeborn), `the_turning_word` (threnodist+syllogist) — are **exact antipodal pairs**, and each carries
a bound about the joining itself (*"the two poles fight"*). A minted braid gets none of it.
**Four small additions, all from data `traditions.json` already carries (`opposite`, `adjacent`):**
1. `ringDistance(a,b)` — 0 same → 4 antipodal.
2. Cost × tensionFactor — adjacent 1.0 · far 1.4 · **antipodal 1.8**.
3. **The tension bound** — ONE bound the parents never had (the cost of the joining), COST-class, far/antipodal
   only, none for adjacent. Additive on the braid's own reach, so it does not widen the boundary.
4. `requiresPoles` on minted braids — free from `minted.from`; dual-pole gating is now a **four-instance
   category** (checks 6e), and otherwise only hand-authored braids are ever gated.
**Do NOT block antipodal braids** — expensive and marked, never forbidden. They are the best braids in the game.
**TEST OF DONE:** mint one adjacent and one antipodal braid. The antipodal must cost visibly more **and** carry
a tension bound; the adjacent must carry neither. Identical output = the generator still cannot see the ring.

## SNG-002 — Encounters engine (RATIFIED — spec next)
Typed encounter layer over existing d100 resolution. Three encounter types, all content-defined in `content/packs/*/encounters/`:
- **Duel/battle:** opponent stat block (health, threat, spectrum, tactics tags); round loop — player roll vs. opponent threat each round; positioning/condition tags; flee/yield/decisive-end conditions. GM narrates per-round receipts.
- **Challenge:** multi-stage skill gauntlet (N stages, each a typed action; partial failures cost health/energy/time, not full stop).
- **Puzzle:** riddle/mechanism objects; attempt costs; hint tiers gated through the sense filter; codex facts can unlock approaches.
Engine module `engine/encounters.js`; generic, no content specifics. Existing resolution math untouched. Companion assists and abilities work inside rounds. Every new write path gets a smoke test. GM contract gains an encounter receipt block (load-bearing rule additions → Erik ratifies final wording).

## SNG-003 — Ability catalog expansion (content — Aevi self-ratified, Aevi authors)
8 → ~36 abilities: 12 harmonic, 12 radiant, 12 unaligned "valley craft" (tracker, herbalist, mediator, tinker, waywright, storykeeper…). Full 3-rank trees with grants/cannot/notFor per existing schema. Valley origin stops being the poverty pick.

## SNG-005 — Companion bonds & evolution (promoted from §9 specced-unbuilt)
Bond value −10..10 (same bands as NPC relationships) grown by shared deeds/assists/time. Bond tiers unlock: assist cap raise → companion-specific granted abilities → **evolution stages defined in companion JSON** (form, knowledge, voice shifts at thresholds — Aevi's motes brighten, condense, learn). GM sees bond band + stage every turn. Migration: existing companions start at bond 0, stage 1.

## SNG-007 — Character sheet & inventory screens (NEW — Erik field report 2026-07-04)
Post-creation, the character's own record is invisible to the player:
- **Character screen:** full view — bio/backstory (currently GM-only after creation), attributes/sub-attributes with per-sub current/20 bars and the soft-cap knee at 4 marked, abilities with ranks and tree progress, aptitudes, XP/level, custom abilities, active quests summary. Reachable any time from the main UI.
- **Inventory screen:** first-class full view (catalog details, equipment slots/bonuses, use/examine/drop) — not just the sidebar strip.
Absorbs SNG-006 (creation-screen point bars) — same component, shown at creation and in-play.

## SNG-004 — Origins & backgrounds as content (design-law compliance + variety)
Move origins and backgrounds out of `app.js` into `content/packs/*/origins/` + `backgrounds/` with mechanical hooks: starting spectrum tilt, ability-system access, background skill grants, creation copy. Then add: mountain-pass folk, Disputed Zone survivor, Archive-born, **unusual embodiment category** (the ENT precedent — GM handles nonhuman gracefully; make it a supported choice with its own hooks), and the five beyond-the-pass civilizations as they open. Backgrounds expand similarly.

## SNG-008 — Heimrún, Council of Mavens, framework weave (content wave, rides with SNG-004)
- **Rune shrine / rune-caster NPC:** casting as mechanic — a cast grants the day's omen: small spectrum-axis nudge; rune meanings seeded from Heimrún's canonical data. Optional settings hook to link external Heimrún casts as the day's omen.
- **Council of Mavens faction:** petitionable advisor council; each maven a persistent NPC with domain + bias; counsel can conflict; sense filter mediates whose read to trust.
- **Framework layer (lore canon, GM-eyes-only):** Precursor mystery converges on contraction/foreclosure as the force behind the water crisis. Glimpsed, never explained.

## Ordering (2026-07-04, Erik: emergence bumped ahead of origins)
**SNG-009 hotfix (ACTIVE build) → SNG-010 Practice & Emergence → SNG-001 party play → SNG-004 origins (+SNG-008 weave) →** remaining §9.
SNG-010 recipe layer pre-authored at `content/packs/core/rules/emergence_recipes.json`.
