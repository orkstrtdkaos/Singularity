# PO Backlog — Singularity

*Owned by Aevi (PO). Order below is build order. CCode sessions: active task is always `po/ALERT.md`; this file is the queue behind it. One goal per session — decompose on pickup if a task won't fit one session.*

**Ratifications on record (2026-07-04):** Erik ratified the Encounters direction (SNG-002) — new engine layer on top of existing resolution, resolution math itself unchanged.

---

## SNG-002 — Encounters engine (RATIFIED — spec next)
Typed encounter layer over existing d100 resolution. Three encounter types, all content-defined in `content/packs/*/encounters/`:
- **Duel/battle:** opponent stat block (health, threat, spectrum, tactics tags); round loop — player roll vs. opponent threat each round; positioning/condition tags; flee/yield/decisive-end conditions. GM narrates per-round receipts.
- **Challenge:** multi-stage skill gauntlet (N stages, each a typed action; partial failures cost health/energy/time, not full stop).
- **Puzzle:** riddle/mechanism objects; attempt costs; hint tiers gated through the sense filter; codex facts can unlock approaches.
Engine module `engine/encounters.js`; generic, no content specifics. Existing resolution math untouched. Companion assists and abilities work inside rounds. Every new write path gets a smoke test. GM contract gains an encounter receipt block (load-bearing rule additions → Erik ratifies final wording).

## SNG-003 — Ability catalog expansion (content — Aevi self-ratified, Aevi authors)
8 → ~36 abilities: 12 harmonic, 12 radiant, 12 unaligned "valley craft" (tracker, herbalist, mediator, tinker, waywright, storykeeper…). Full 3-rank trees with grants/cannot/notFor per existing schema. Valley origin stops being the poverty pick.

## SNG-005 — Companion bonds & evolution (promoted from §9 specced-unbuilt)
Bond value −10..10 (same bands as NPC relationships) grown by shared deeds/assists/time. Bond tiers unlock: assist cap raise → companion-specific granted abilities → **evolution stages defined in companion JSON** (form, knowledge, voice shifts at thresholds — Aevi's motes brighten, condense, learn). GM sees bond band + stage every turn. Migration: existing companions start at bond 0, stage 1.

## SNG-007 — Character sheet & inventory screens (NEW — Erik field report 2026-07-04)
Post-creation, the character's own record is invisible to the player:
- **Character screen:** full view — bio/backstory (currently GM-only after creation), attributes/sub-attributes with per-sub current/20 bars and the soft-cap knee at 4 marked, abilities with ranks and tree progress, aptitudes, XP/level, custom abilities, active quests summary. Reachable any time from the main UI.
- **Inventory screen:** first-class full view (catalog details, equipment slots/bonuses, use/examine/drop) — not just the sidebar strip.
Absorbs SNG-006 (creation-screen point bars) — same component, shown at creation and in-play.

## SNG-004 — Origins & backgrounds as content (design-law compliance + variety)
Move origins and backgrounds out of `app.js` into `content/packs/*/origins/` + `backgrounds/` with mechanical hooks: starting spectrum tilt, ability-system access, background skill grants, creation copy. Then add: mountain-pass folk, Disputed Zone survivor, Archive-born, **unusual embodiment category** (the ENT precedent — GM handles nonhuman gracefully; make it a supported choice with its own hooks), and the five beyond-the-pass civilizations as they open. Backgrounds expand similarly.

## SNG-008 — Heimrún, Council of Mavens, framework weave (content wave, rides with SNG-004)
- **Rune shrine / rune-caster NPC:** casting as mechanic — a cast grants the day's omen: small spectrum-axis nudge; rune meanings seeded from Heimrún's canonical data. Optional settings hook to link external Heimrún casts as the day's omen.
- **Council of Mavens faction:** petitionable advisor council; each maven a persistent NPC with domain + bias; counsel can conflict; sense filter mediates whose read to trust.
- **Framework layer (lore canon, GM-eyes-only):** Precursor mystery converges on contraction/foreclosure as the force behind the water crisis. Glimpsed, never explained.

## Ordering after SNG-001 (party play) ships
**SNG-002 → SNG-007 → SNG-003 → SNG-005 → SNG-004 (+008) →** remaining §9 specced-unbuilt items.
Rationale: encounters give scenes teeth first; the sheet/inventory screens make the character legible while playing the new encounters; then content waves land into a game that can carry them.
