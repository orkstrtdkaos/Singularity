# Singularity — Running Spec Backlog

Engine-needing work accumulated during the 2026-07 content-expansion sessions. All CONTENT for these is authored/authorable at origin; these are the CODE pieces. Aevi maintains this list; Erik greenlights turning from content to systems. Nothing here blocks continued content authoring.

---

## Pending ratified builds (small, content ready)
- **SNG-BATCH-5** — soft class-cost (2x secondary) + branch forks + feel refinements. Content ready (skill_capacity.json crossClass, branch_forks.json). Ratified, assembled, awaiting CCode. *(Note: prior local CCode run reportedly got "almost all the way through" — verify state before re-running.)*

## Systems batch candidates (medium specs; share machinery)
- **Money + The Game + Recruitment** (the_game_and_coin.json content ready). Wallet + wealthLevel; location-flavored prices; Game-standing track + stake-transfer; recruit-as-party-member with joinReason {pay|purpose|bond} + loyalty. Reuses check/challenge/bond engines.
- **SNG-017 — Creation overhaul.** Origins = areas of the world (not just Valley); start location follows origin; innate-talent step (innate_talents.json ready); ability pool from origin's tradition; optional will-channel pick. Data-drive from origins.json (Aevi owes content).
- **SNG-018 — Romance/intimacy track.** Relationship track beyond bond; romanceable flag + fit-hints (Aevi owes content); staged, consent-respecting, GM-honored, surface-appropriate register. Reuses relationship/bond/reputation.
- **SNG-016 — 12-axis skill breadth.** RESOLVED as design (Reaches = crafts; six near-axis traditions authored). Remaining: engine derives adjacency/purity from poleIntensity vectors; learning a Reach tradition gated by presence-in-region; geographic leveling. Design proposal delivered via the coordinate/Reach lore.

## Engine flags from world-model corrections (light)
- **Pole-intensity model** — engine reads location.poleIntensity (independent 0..1 poles), computes co-firing + purity from it; net-signed derivable for back-compat. (Locations already reseeded.)
- **Axes-as-disposition** — framing only; no mechanical change (GM narration guidance in world_framing.json).
- **World (not Valley)** — later clean rename of valley/ pack to world/ (do NOT mid-flight; breaks manifest). Origins startable outside the Valley (ties to SNG-017).
- **Manifest locals** — locations gain optional seedFiction + nativeLogic (GM enforces a native domain's internal rules as LAW inside it); creatures gain native-domain tag + diffusion weight so encounter tables place them out-of-context. Content-heavy, one light enforcement flag.
- **Will-expression / Inscription** — abilities gain optional `inscribable` flag + rune-cost; inscription = slow/persistent cast channel; substrate-density gates where runes/inscription work. Cross-tradition modality.
- **Innate talents** — creation stores character.talent; permanent, non-spendable; grows in expression. (Ties SNG-017.)
- **Methods** — rune-casting/coordinate-reading/attunement resolve as tool-or-skill-gated checks that REVEAL poleIntensity (rune dice) or adjacency (compass); light method-resolution path.

## Notes
- All content (locations, NPCs, companions, items, Reach traditions, lore, jewels, domains) is authored directly to origin and needs no engine work to EXIST as data — only these systems to fully ACTIVATE their mechanics.
- Suggested grouping when Erik greenlights: **SNG-BATCH-6 = SNG-017 creation + SNG-018 romance + money/Game/recruitment** (they share relationship + economy machinery). Pole-intensity + manifest-locals enforcement flags fold in as small additions.

## SNG-019 — Codex entity-resolution (facts collect under primary nodes)
Erik 2026-07-07: the codex reads as a running list; ~20 facts about Teva end up scattered instead of gathered under her node. Diagnosis (verified in engine/codex.js): the codex IS already a typed-node graph (topics keyed by slug, kind person/place/lore/event/faction/mystery, facts[], links[]). The bug is ENTITY RESOLUTION, not storage — applyCodexUpdates slugifies u.topic per update, so "Teva", "the woman in the chamber", "Teva the healer" mint three nodes. Fix so facts land on the right primary node:
1. **Alias resolution on write.** Each topic gains `aliases[]`. Before minting a new topic, resolve u.topic against existing topics' label+aliases (case/fuzzy/substring, and prefer a known NPC/location id from CONTENT when u.kind is person/place). Match → append the fact + record the alias; no match → mint. A canonical id for known entities (npc/location ids) is the anchor so the GM's varying phrasings collapse to one node.
2. **GM contract nudge.** codexUpdates should prefer a stable `entityId` when the fact is about a known NPC/place (the GM already gets npc/place ids in context); free-text topic only for genuinely new things. Add the field; resolver uses entityId first, label/alias second.
3. **Merge tool.** A one-shot pass that collapses existing duplicate topics into their primary (by label/alias similarity + shared links), concatenating facts (dedup) and unioning links/aliases — repairs saves already fragmented. Player-facing "these look like the same — merge?" optional; auto-merge high-confidence.
4. **Codex UI grouping.** Group the codex view by kind, primary node first with its facts nested; show aliases; a person/place node surfaces its linked nodes (Teva → the chamber, the rescue event, whoever she's tied to). Facts already carry [dN] day stamps — keep them, order chronological under the node.
- Caps already exist (60 topics, 12 facts/topic); raise factsPerTopic for primary characters if needed (a major NPC may warrant 20+).
- Smoke: two differently-phrased facts about the same NPC land on one node; entityId beats label; the merge pass collapses a pre-fragmented save; UI shows nodes with nested facts + links, not a flat list.

## SNG-020 — Generative content with persistence (ALL types) — world grows through play
GENERALIZED (Erik 2026-07-07): every authored type is a TEMPLATE; the engine generates more of each WITH PERSISTENCE, so the world grows as people play. Not just NPCs/locations — also companions, items, methods, jewels (co-firing nodes), manifest domains, arcs/quest-threads, cyclical events, creatures, universal-role instances. Framing: generative_substrate.json (template library = the whole authored corpus; grammar = poleIntensity disposition + universal role + seedFiction + arc-pressure + season).
- **One path:** generate(type, context) over all schema'd types — LLM-authors to schema under local-disposition constraints, validates/repairs, mints entityId, persists. Uses the authored files as few-shot taste, so generated content matches quality + is in-grain (Stillhold-generated reads peace+falsehood; Redline warrior fights by the Edge; asymmetric secondary axis rolled for surprise).
- **Persistence:** durable nodes in the codex (SNG-019 entityId resolution) + a per-save generated-content store; facts accumulate; world-tick (SNG-021) advances generated arcs/NPCs offscreen. No one-scene ghosts.
- **Optional shared growth:** proven-good generated content promotable from a synced save into canonical world content — play literally grows the shared world (flag; personal-save persistence first).
- **Depends on:** SNG-019 (clean entity persistence). Anchor of the systems batch. NO additional content owed — the corpus IS the template library.
- **Smoke:** each type generates in-grain for its locale + persists with stable identity + accumulating facts; a generated location/domain is revisitable with state intact; a generated arc advances offscreen; authored vs generated indistinguishable downstream.
## SNG-021 — Living world (cyclical events + self-driven NPCs)
Content ready: the_living_world.json (season×place festival/cycle table, recurring troubles, population doctrine). Engine: world-tick checks current season/day against the cycle table and surfaces 'what's happening here now' to the GM; key NPCs get an offscreen want-progress counter so a place MOVES between visits; failed-harvest + pass-freeze as world-tick conditions with cascading effects; generated NPCs (SNG-020) get a want on creation. Light additions to worldtick.js + a per-NPC arc-progress field. GM mandate: always able to answer 'what's happening here that isn't about me.' Smoke: arriving in a place during its festival season surfaces the festival; an NPC met twice has advanced their want; a failed harvest cascades pressure.

## Universal roles — weave into SNG-017 / SNG-020 / SNG-021
universal_roles.json defines loose worldwide roles (mediator/warrior/warden/keeper/maker/seeker) whose METHOD comes from locale+disposition. Weave: **SNG-020 generation** picks a ROLE for a needed NPC then derives method from the current area's poleIntensity (a Cogitarium 'healer' works against the local grain; a Stillhold 'mediator' buries truth) — role+disposition yields consistent, varied, never-generic people. **SNG-017 creation** frames origins as role+homeland (Redline Warrior, Hollow-March Warden) — familiar handle + local craft-access. **SNG-021 living-world** populates for role-contrast friction and places traveled-roles as living evidence needs cross regions. Content ready; these are reference-wirings, not new engine work.

## SNG-022 — Reconciliation engine (bring characters + content up to current on login/load)
Erik 2026-07-07: as engine + content-types evolve, an engine must reconcile existing characters and existing content against everything now built, and apply what's owed — e.g. an Ent created before innate talents existed should GAIN its talent on next login; a location authored before poleIntensity should get it; a character newly eligible for a Reach tradition or a universal-role tag should have it surfaced. Generalizes the EXISTING backfill.js (already a versioned, idempotent, character.backfillVersion-flagged one-time-credit system for XP/bonds/practice) into a full reconciliation pass.

**Model:** a single `reconcile(entity, kind)` pass, run on character login AND on content-load, bumping a per-entity `reconcileVersion`. Idempotent (only applies what's missing), capped, principled (derives from durable state, never fabricates history) — same discipline backfill.js already uses. Each new feature registers a MIGRATION STEP; reconcile runs all steps whose version exceeds the entity's reconcileVersion.

**Character migration steps (examples, extensible):**
- **Innate talent:** character has no `talent` → grant one (roll weighted-minor, or offer a choice on login for existing characters so it isn't imposed). Erik's Ent gets its talent. New characters get it at creation (SNG-017).
- **Reach-tradition eligibility:** character now in/of a region whose tradition they qualify for → surface the newly-available abilities as learnable (don't auto-grant power; make it AVAILABLE).
- **Universal-role tag:** untagged NPC/character → infer role+method from their data + locale (universal_roles.json).
- **poleIntensity on characters:** derive a character's own disposition-drift vector if missing (from abilities/deeds), so affinities + drift work for old saves.
- **New fields:** any additive schema field (statusNote, establishedFacts, wallet, romance track, etc.) → initialize to safe default (this is the sweep pattern already used on Tether profiles).

**Content migration steps (run on content-load):**
- **poleIntensity backfill:** any location with spectrum but no poleIntensity → derive it (already done manually for the 26 built; the step makes it automatic for future/generated content).
- **Schema-version upgrades:** any content record below current schemaVersion → apply the field additions (seedFiction/nativeLogic defaults, universalRole, evolution scaffolds).
- **Cross-reference integrity:** connections/links that point at now-existing nodes get wired; dangling refs flagged.

**Login UX:** on login, if reconcile applied anything player-facing, tell them: "The world has grown — you've discovered an innate talent (choose/see it); three new traditions are learnable near you." Growth as a login moment, not a silent patch. Non-player-facing backfills stay silent.

**Guardrails:** idempotent (reconcileVersion gate); never REMOVES or downgrades; never fabricates history (derives from durable state); player-facing GRANTS that change power are offered/surfaced, not auto-imposed, unless purely additive (a talent everyone gets). Reuses backfill.js's principled-reconstruction discipline. Order-independent steps; each self-checks preconditions.

**Smoke:** an Ent created pre-talents gains a talent on login (offered, not forced); a pre-poleIntensity location gets one on load; a character newly eligible for a tradition sees it as learnable; running reconcile twice changes nothing the second time; no history fabricated; purely-additive fields initialize silently.

**Depends on / enables:** builds on backfill.js (extend, don't replace). Pairs with SNG-020 (generated content runs through the same reconcile so it's born current) and SNG-019 (entity resolution). This is the engine that keeps the whole growing world SELF-CONSISTENT as both content and rules change — arguably the linchpin of the systems batch, because without it every new feature strands existing characters and content.
